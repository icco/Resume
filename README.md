# Resume

This used to be a nice little tool for generating resumes. If you wanna see that, check out [v1.0.0](https://github.com/icco/Resume/releases/tag/1.0.0). That's the reason my resume has 200+ stars. It was before things like Jekyll and Middleman existed, so it made it to the front page of hn and everything.

Now, this site is just raw html and css, because that's easier. At some point, I'll probably just give up and send people to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natwelch).
